AndroidGraphicLib
=================

A 2D Graphical library for android using OpenGL ES 2.0

You can draw simples shapes (triangles, circle, regular polygons, polygons, rectangles, polylines, ...) with a the shader you want (or the default shader to fill a shape with the same color). Also, you can do render offscreen using framebuffer.

For now the first button (and all the package com.agl.exemple) is functional. But the example 2 is under development.
